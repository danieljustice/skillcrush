      <h2>There are songs about Buttercups!</h2>
      <p>
        Since I can remember The Foundations have had a song out called <em>Build Me Up Buttercup</em>.  On sunny days I find myself singing the first two versus of the song...  I'd sing more, but I can never remember more...

        Why do you build me up (build me up) Buttercup, baby
        <br>
        Just to let me down (let me down) and mess me around
        <br>
        And then worst of all (worst of all) you never call, baby
        <br>
        When you say you will (say you will) but I love you still
        <br>
        I need you (I need you) more than anyone, darlin'
        <br>
        You know that I have from the start
        <br>
        So build me up (build me up) Buttercup, don't break my heart
      </p>
      <p>
        "I'll be over at ten", you told me time and again
        <br>
        But you're late, I wait around and then (bah-dah-dah)
        <br>
        I went to the door, I can't take any more
        <br>
        It's not you, you let me down again
      </p>
